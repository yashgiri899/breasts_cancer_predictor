#Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression

📌 Overview

This project implements a Logistic Regression model to predict breast cancer (Benign or Malignant) using a dataset of tumor characteristics. The model is trained on real-world breast cancer data and evaluated for accuracy.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is breast_cancer_dataset.csv.

It contains multiple features extracted from breast tumor samples.

The target variable indicates whether the tumor is Benign (2) or Malignant (4).

🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yashgiri899/breast-cancer-prediction.git
cd breast-cancer-prediction

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 How to Run

Ensure the dataset (breast_cancer_dataset.csv) is in the project directory.

Run the Python script:

python breast_cancer.py

📊 Results

Accuracy: ~95.6%

Confusion Matrix:

[[84  3]
 [ 3 47]]

🔥 Future Improvements

Experiment with other classification models (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Apply Hyperparameter Tuning to optimize model performance.

Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.
